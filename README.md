# ScreenSeal Windows v1.0

A professional Windows desktop utility for hiding sensitive information on screen with real-time mosaic overlays.
CodeRabbit 테스트 중!

Place ScreenSeal's mosaic windows over passwords, personal data, or other sensitive content during screen recordings and screenshots. The mosaic window itself is invisible to screenshots and screen sharing — only the mosaic effect is captured.
